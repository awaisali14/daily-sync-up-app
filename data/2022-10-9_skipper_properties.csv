The result is a private family compound of the finest caliber. In addition to the 10,000 square foot main house, accommodation includes three, three-bedroom guest cottages; a two-bedroom staff cottage, as well as a poolhouse, and a charming beach pavilion. Gated entry, a 75- by 40- foot, zero-edge pool, a croquet lawn, acres of rolling lawns for myriad recreational pursuits, and the pink sands of Grape Bay Beach are among the many amenities. Chelston now stands among the most significant estates in the world. .<br /><br /> Originally designed and constructed between 1939-1941 for Carbon Petroleum Dubbs (an innovator of the 'cracking' process through which crude oil is refined), Chelston was conveyed to the Government of The United States of America in 1964. For over 30 years, the property served as the official Bermuda residence of the United States Consul General. The list of distinguished visitors to Chelston is lengthy. In addition to President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, guests included Senator John Kerry, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, General Colin Powell, former Democratic Presidential contender Michael Dukakis, and Mrs. Dukakis, former Secretary of State Edwin Meese, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, President Ronald Reagan's daughter Maureen, newspaper columnist Ann Landers , actor Michael Douglas, and model/actress Brooke Shields, to name a few. Chelston is especially well loved in the Bermuda community for its memorable July 4th extravaganzas, at which more than 2,000 guests gathered each year to celebrate America's birthday.<br><br>Special Features: Chelston is singular in Bermuda as a large-acreage, fully updated, private beachfront compound located within a five-minute drive of the City of Hamilton. The main house occupies a commanding position approximately 200 feet above sea level with awe-inspiring views of the Atlantic Ocean, the City of Hamilton, and the gardens and sweeping lawns that comprise the estate. <br><br>Exemplifying understated elegance and incorporating the best of traditional Bermuda design, the main house, on three levels, is light-filled and spacious. High ‘Bermuda tray' ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, multiple sets of French doors, generous room proportions and a general consistency of finishes throughout the estate are Chelston's hallmarks. A pleasing floor tile, reminiscent of seashells, serves as foundation for many rooms. Also throughout the estate, the furring of Bermuda stone walls has enabled the use of wallpapers - a true rarity in Bermuda.<br><br>There are many beautiful custom finishes throughout the property, for example:<br><br>The graceful dining room wallpaper was sent to China to be hand-painted especially for Chelston. A subtle Italian wall paper is also used extensive throughout the estate.<br><br>A salt-water aquarium with a living coral reef highlights the library. <br> <br>The lower level includes a well-equipped home cinema, a family room and a gym, as well as a two-bedroom/two bathroom manager's suite.<br><br>Subtle artisan glass frames not only the magnificent yew-wood front door but also the entrance to the estate's horticultural office. <br><br>On the terrace beside the nearly Olympic-size swimming pool, a rare Chinese stone fireplace in the shape of a five-armed dragon makes the flower-draped pergola enticing throughout the seasons. <br> <br>And overlooking the pink sands and turquoise waters of Grape Bay, the little pavilion known as Obsipo is a welcoming retreat with a wood-burning pizza oven for beachfront lunches and dinners.<br><br>Photo Credit: JP Rouja/LookBermuda and Dan Forer</p>",House,,10/22/2018,0,0,1,0,35000000,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,International,,,,,,,0,0,,"[b'303', b'Christies International Real Estate | Sinclair Realty ', b'Christies International Real Estate | Sinclair Realty ', b'estates@sinclairrealty.com', b'1-441-296-0278']","[b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/1.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/2.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/3.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/4.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/5.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/6.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/7.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/8.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/9.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/10.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/11.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/12.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/13.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/14.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/15.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/16.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/17.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/18.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/19.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/20.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/21.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/22.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/23.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/24.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/28938/lg/25.jpg']"

The two properties comprise over 36,000 square feet and sit on just over a third of an acre.<br />
The City of Hamilton was given its name by the House of Assembly in 1790 and the lots which  the Walker Arcade property was built on were purchased in the early 1800's.The property was initially designed to accommodate the operational requirements of B.W. Walker & Co, trading as importers and exporters. As the city grew during the next 100 years, the design and use of commercial property evolved to accommodate the changing times and in 1932 the owners invested significant capital to refurbish and join the existing buildings in order to create the well know arcade which connects Reid and Front Streets. The new development created 24 shops, 3 apartments and 14 warehouses. In 1994 the Walker Arcade was once again redecorated and modernized, creating a total of 31 rental units in the building. The distinctive property adjacent to the Walker Arcade overlooking Front Street and occupied by Calypso, was constructed in 1897 by Thomas Miles in order to house his grocery store. The owners of these two properties over several generations recognized that in order to remain relevant in the commercial market place, redevelopment was imperative in the life cycle of commercial real estate in the city. <br />

Spacious and airy with 4-5 bedrooms, the single-level home offers Bermuda's famous South Shore horizon views. With a long and successful track record as a holiday rental, Coral Sea serves equally well as a primary residence. Originally constructed in the 1940s as a two-bedroom cottage by Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., who served as the US Secretary of State during WWII (1944-45), the property takes its name from the battle of Coral Sea. The current owner has made numerous updates in recent years, infusing this home with an easy and elegant ambience. The living room, dining room, and adjoining sunroom are generous and light-filled. The recently refurbished kitchen adjoins the informal dining area and family room, off which two of the bedrooms are located. The master bedroom suite provides an especially tranquil haven with ocean views and fireplace. Two additional guests suites complete the existing floor plan.

Spanish Grange's three acres offer potential for subdivision or even the addition of further dwellings on estate -- an option made all the more attractive because of the existence of a second entrance leading to the estate from South Road.</p>",House,,3/8/2021,0,0,1,0,5950000,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,International,,,,,,,0,0,,"[b'303', b'Christies International Real Estate | Sinclair Realty ', b'Christies International Real Estate | Sinclair Realty ', b'estates@sinclairrealty.com', b'1-441-296-0278']","[b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/1.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/2.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/3.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/4.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/5.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/6.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/7.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/8.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/9.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/10.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/11.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/12.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/13.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/14.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/15.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/16.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/17.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/18.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/19.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/20.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/21.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/22.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/23.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/24.jpg', b'https://www.propertyskipper.com/assets/properties/33468/lg/25.jpg']"
